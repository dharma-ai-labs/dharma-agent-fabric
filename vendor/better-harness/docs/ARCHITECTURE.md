# Architecture Principles

This file is the accepted repository-wide owner of architecture principles,
ownership boundaries, and AI-facing routing rules. Detailed decisions are
indexed in [Architecture Decision Records](adrs/README.md). The
[directory-structure ADR](adrs/directory-structure.md) owns directory status;
the [developer-experience-system ADR](adrs/developer-experience-system.md) owns
the target journey, contract, evidence, governance, and DX-measurement system.

- Build minimum runnable atomic capabilities: each `scripts/<capability>/` should be copyable, executable, testable, and distributable.
- Put command execution in `cli.mjs`; add `index.mjs` only when other modules need a public import surface.
- The primary root CLI `scripts/better-harness.mjs` must stay a thin facade: it
  dispatches to capability-owned commands with argv arrays and must not own
  product logic, schemas, fixtures, or host adapters.
- Compose through public surfaces; do not import another capability's private helpers, fixtures, or provider modules.
- Keep product judgment in canonical owners such as `skills/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/`, `models/`, `schemas/` (a target owner, not yet created), `templates/`, and `references/`; host shells stay thin.
- Use business-named boundaries, not generic umbrellas such as `scripts/core/`.
- Runtime behavior needs a contract plus validation evidence: fixtures, tests, smoke commands, or parser-safe output. CLI facades need help, unknown-command, and delegated-output coverage.
- Reader-facing prose produced by an AI mutation workflow stays owned by that AI.
  Deterministic writers may validate, revision-check, persist, and project the
  supplied copy, but they do not compose or translate it; host UIs render the
  persisted semantic copy instead of rebuilding it from structural metadata.
- Keep host evidence adapters separate from packaging, and keep all automation cross-platform.
- Keep stable host identity, display, home-option, and support-slice metadata in
  `scripts/host-support/`. Executable adapter imports and construction remain in
  capability-local registries; do not introduce a global host service locator.
- Keep source-local host artifact assembly under `scripts/packaging/`; generated
  host artifacts are validation/install outputs, not canonical product owners or
  public package or Qoder runtime inputs.

## Directory Conventions

- `scripts/` is for automation entrypoints used by hooks, Qoder, Codex, or other non-interactive workflows. Put ad-hoc debugging and preview helpers in `dev/`.
- Keep helper `.mjs` directories modular: one narrow concern, small entrypoints, and no catch-all modules.
- New analyzers, scoring signals, and hook helpers should own modules when they represent distinct concerns.
- Executable behavior belongs in business-named `scripts/<capability>/`; do not create `scripts/core/`.
- Existing `scripts/core-change-watch/` and `scripts/session-analysis/` remain live owners until a tested migration lands.
- `scripts/harness-analysis/canvas-preview/` owns reusable local Canvas serving,
  runtime discovery, transforms, the Harness preview fixture, and cross-platform
  browser helpers. Keeping it below `harness-analysis/` preserves the tested
  copy/install boundary; the historical `canvas-preview-server.mjs` path is a
  thin compatibility entrypoint.
- `scripts/harness-analysis/report-source/` owns the report-source contract and
  its bounded human-review integrity chain: packet binding, episode/delivery
  normalization, and review application. Non-facade consumers import its public
  `index.mjs`; historical flat paths remain compatibility entrypoints.
- `schemas/` is a target owner, not yet created, for versioned public runtime contracts consumed by multiple repo surfaces or packaged hosts; see the directory-structure ADR for adoption criteria. Capability-private schemas stay under `scripts/<capability>/`.

## AI Directory Routing

- Start from the [ADR index](adrs/README.md). The directory-structure ADR is
  this file's detailed AI-optimized directory-status reference, while the DX
  system ADR governs cross-surface experience contracts and activation gates.
- For open-source community extensibility, start from `docs/community.md` and route intent -> owner -> contract -> evidence -> activation -> validation -> packaging before adding surfaces.
- Put shared user workflows in root `skills/`; use `.agents/skills/` only for host-local skills, generated mirrors, or wrappers.
- Use each `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` as the host-local entrypoint; do not add mirror sidecar metadata.
- Put reusable role/persona prompts in `agent-roles/` (a target directory, not yet created; see the directory-structure ADR for adoption criteria) only when they contain no workflow steps and have a second skill/host consumer.
- Keep skill-specific evidence, artifact, output, and validation rules under `skills/<skill>/references/`.
- Treat `knowledge-base/` as a candidate directory, not yet created (see the directory-structure ADR for adoption criteria), until schema, fixtures, registry compilation, explicit consumer binding, and mapping tests pass.
- Put prose guidance in `references/`, examples and operating models in `case-studies/`, and runtime behavior in `skills/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/`, or `templates/` with tests.
- For shared reference placement, start from `references/README.md`: session
  evidence lives under `references/session-evidence/`, static project and
  delivery evidence under `references/project-harness/`, Agent asset guidance
  under `references/agent-customize/`, and repeated-work owner selection under
  `references/loop-engineering/`.
- Keep detector and signal contracts with the selected model, executable
  capability, or skill-local owner. Promote shared prose only for two visible
  workflow consumers; do not create a generic detector or signal umbrella.
- Keep `.claude-plugin/`, `.qoder-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`,
  `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/skills/`, and future host shells thin: they expose,
  wrap, mirror, or package canonical behavior; they do not own product judgment.
  The Claude Code shell owns native install/discovery metadata and exposes the
  canonical root skills; Claude configured-asset and session evidence remain
  in the capability-owned agent-customize and session-analysis providers. The Codex shell
  owns local install/discovery metadata only; Codex evidence collection remains
  in the capability-owned provider and session-analysis modules. The public npm
  package ships all seven plugin metadata roots, while the Qoder runtime bundle
  includes only `.qoder-plugin/`.

## Developer Experience Routing

- Read the
  [Developer Experience System ADR](adrs/developer-experience-system.md) before
  changing public product routes, Quickstarts, CLI/help/error contracts,
  Preview prerequisites, host support declarations, diagnostics, support or
  privacy behavior, release claims, or DX metrics.
- Treat the DX system as a federated control plane. Capability owners retain
  behavior and judgment; cross-surface tooling may index, validate, compare,
  and project their public declarations.
- Keep curated prose and translations author-owned. Generate or validate only
  structured facts unless an accepted spec establishes a narrower deterministic
  ownership boundary.
- Keep fixture, package, native-host, installed-application, deployed-site, and
  post-publish evidence distinct. One evidence class does not satisfy another
  class's acceptance gate.
- Do not route Better Harness's own DX governance through the runtime
  `software-fluency` report model. Changes to report-model routing require their
  own spec and validation.

## Template Boundaries

- Keep report-generation contracts under `templates/reporting/`: `routing.md` owns report/style/output selection, `report-structure.md` owns Markdown structure, and the mode files own runtime and validation contracts.
- Style templates own visual grammar, not runnable skeletons. Keep `templates/style/*.md` directive and style-specific; do not add style-specific TSX examples or shared Canvas skeletons.

## Agent-Friendly CLI Contracts

- Design CLI entrypoints as human-first defaults with machine-first contracts: readable help and summaries by default, plus explicit JSON, JSONL, or schema surfaces for agents and automation.
- Keep stdout parser-safe in machine modes. JSON/JSONL output must not include spinners, colors, progress text, or human diagnostics; logs, warnings, and errors belong on stderr unless they are part of a documented JSON error envelope.
- Make command surfaces discoverable without source reading. Root facades may expose command inventory and schema metadata, but delegated behavior, capability-private output schemas, fixtures, and product judgment stay under capability-owned directories.
- Classify every registered command and subcommand as `workflow`, `advanced`, or
  `maintainer`. Human help defaults to workflow routes and expands explicitly;
  machine inventory stays complete by default and reports the audience metadata.
- Preserve argv-array dispatch across platforms. Use Node and Git portability primitives such as `process.execPath`, `spawn`/`spawnSync` argument arrays, `path.join`, and `path.resolve`; avoid shell-string dispatch.
- Treat non-interactive execution as a first-class path. Agent-safe commands should support explicit flags such as `--json`, `--no-color`, `--quiet`, `--no-input`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--limit`, `--output`, and `--timeout` when those modes apply.
- Separate planning from mutation. Destructive or externally visible actions need a plan/dry-run/draft phase before apply/publish, and the write phase must require explicit confirmation in non-interactive workflows.
- Keep CLI, MCP, hooks, skills, and host shells on the same core behavior. MCP exposes tools, hooks enforce lifecycle checks, skills own repeatable workflows, and the CLI remains the stable human/CI/agent command protocol.
